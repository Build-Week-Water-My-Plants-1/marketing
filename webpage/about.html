        <h1>Plant2o</h1>
        <p>Plant2o is an app that does things. Things that will help your plants receive water. I am currently waiting on exactly how those things will work. But for now, all I have to work with is creating this long filler paragraph. I could have used Lorem Ipsum but why not treat it like a diary?</p>
        <p>Alright, I think this should be long enough to cover the area I may need for the app description.</p>
        <p>Stay golden ponyboy.</p>

    <section class="planOne">
        <h2>Plan 1</h2>
        <p>That is, assuming the app folk are chosing to include payment plans of some sort.</p>

    <section class="planTwo">
        <h2>Plan 2</h2>
        <p>I'm not sure. I guess we'll have to see won't we? Hopefully I won't have to add them last minute.</p>
